Melt the chocolate and butter together in a saucepan over a medium heat.
Stir the cocoa powder,sugar and vanilla extract.
Take off the heat and whisk in the eggs one at a time.
Tear off a piece of greaseproof paper and scrunch into a small ball.
Pre-heat the oven to 350 degree Fahrenheit (180 degree celsius).
Place the paper balls in the centre of each hole in a muffin tin. Pour the chocolate doughnut mixture in the muffin tin holes,circling around the paper balls and being careful not to cover them.
Bake in the oven for 8-10 minutes.
Carefully take the doughnuts out of the muffin tin. Take out the paper balls with the help of your fingers. You should have a circle-shaped hole in each doughnut.
Dip in some melted chocolate,followed by some sprinkles.
Enjoy the most delicious doughnuts!!!
